Our team consists of Tao Xu (si19010) and Yinan Yang (ff19085), and assignment is submitted by Tao Xu (si19010).

 Due to the impact of Covid19, we collaboarated remotely via GitHub to co-develop this project.
Our website is an online CV maker, featuring a simple and convenient interface for editing, online storage (at our server) and extensibility (the CV templates are easy to make).
The frontend of our website was based on the Vue framework, taking advantage of Vueâ€™s MVVM, the Model-View-View Model, which helped us in keeping code modular and implementing reactive user interfaces.
The backend of our website was powered by Node.js with Express.js and SQLite.
